## ðŸ§  System Integration Details

For advanced users or developers, the following section describes what happens behind the scenes during installation and removal.

### Installation Process

1. Install `haiquand/yubikey-ssh/sk-libfido2` formula, which compile and install the `sk-libfido2.dylib` into Homebrew `lib` directory (`$(brew --prefix)/lib`).

2. Generates a LaunchAgent plist `com.openssh.sk-libfido2-env.plist` under `~/Library/LaunchAgents` to initialize and persist the `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` environment variable across user sessions.

3. Appends or updates the `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` variable in your shell initialization file (`~/.zshrc`), ensuring it is available in interactive shells without requiring manual configuration.

### Uninstallation Behavior

When uninstalled, the cask automatically performs a cleanup process:

- Removes the generated LaunchAgent `com.openssh.sk-libfido2-env.plist` from `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.

- Deletes the corresponding `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` export line from your `~/.zshrc` file.

This ensures no residual configuration remains after the cask is removed.
